This app is a CMS style blog site similar to a Wordpress site. Developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.  This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
